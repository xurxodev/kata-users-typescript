 - UI will be the command line.
 - All data is local.
 - The data origin will change in the future to consume a remote API.
 - There is no persistence between execution.
 - The dependencies in testing will be replaced by manual fake dependencies without to use any library
 - The business rules must to be validate it using tests
 - Define entities, value objects and use cases
 - Use MVP in the presentation layer
